# About me
I'm first year PhD student at [Analytical Computing (AC)](https://www.ipvs.uni-stuttgart.de/departments/ac/) department of University of Stuttgart and [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI)](https://www.bosch-ai.com), co-supervised by [Prof. Dr. Steffen Staab](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QvpcUn8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Dr. Evgeny Kharlamov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-slpMF8AAAAJ&hl=en). Meanwhile, I'm also [IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de) (International Max Planck Research School for Intelligent Systems) scholar. My research interest includes but not limited to neural-symbolic methods for knowledge representation and reasoning on knowledge graphs. 

//I obtained my master degree in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning(CSML) at University College London with the outstanding academic performance award. Afterwards, I worked as a research student in Huawei Noah's Ark Lab (London base). I obtained my first class honour Bachelor degree of Economics and Statistics at UCL and was supervised by [Dr. Franz Kiraly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/franz-kir%C3%A1ly-10a1391ba/?originalSubdomain=uk) on the topic of probabilistic machine learning toolbox development.  My master's research project, supervised by [Dr. Pontus Stenetorp](https://pontus.stenetorp.se/) and [Dr. Philip Gorinski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pjgorinski/?locale=en_US), investigates the use of truely Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks in multi-hop Question Answering Systems.
