# About me
I'm a postgraduate student studying Computational Statistics and Machine Learning(CSML) at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) and am currently working as research intern in Huawei Noah's Ark Lab (London base). I obtained my first class honour Bachelor degree of Economics and Statistics at UCL and was supervised by [Dr. Franz Kiraly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/franz-kir%C3%A1ly-10a1391ba/?originalSubdomain=uk). Out of my intense interest in machine learning, I started my study in CSML at UCL since 2020. I completed modules including Supervised Learning, Probabilistic Unsupervised Learning, Approximate Inference, Statistical Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, Statitical Data Analysis, ML Seminar, Applied Machine Learning, which exposed me to both fundamentations and SOTA research fields in machine learning. Supervised by [Dr. Pontus Stenetorp](https://pontus.stenetorp.se/) and [Dr. Philip Gorinski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pjgorinski/?locale=en_US), my master research project explores the application of truly Hierarchical Graph Neural Network in Question Answering System. My current research interest lies on natural language processing, graph representation learning, Question Answering and multi-modal learning. I'm particuarly interested in using graphs to model relational and multi-modal data for various downstream tasks. I'm looking for PhD or research assistant opportunities in fields of NLP:)
