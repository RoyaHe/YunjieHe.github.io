# About me
I'm a postgraduate student at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) studying Computational Statistics and Machine Learning(CSML), and I'm now working as a research intern in Huawei Noah's Ark Lab (London base). I obtained my first class honour Bachelor degree of Economics and Statistics at UCL and was supervised by [Dr. Franz Kiraly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/franz-kir%C3%A1ly-10a1391ba/?originalSubdomain=uk) on the topic of probabilistic machine learning toolbox development. Out of my intense interest in machine learning, I continued my studies in CSML at UCL since 2020. I completed modules scuh as Supervised Learning, Probabilistic Unsupervised Learning, Approximate Inference, Statistical Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, Statitical Data Analysis, ML Seminar, and Applied Machine Learning, which introduced me to both fundamentals and SOTA research fields in machine learning. My master's research project, supervised by [Dr. Pontus Stenetorp](https://pontus.stenetorp.se/) and [Dr. Philip Gorinski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pjgorinski/?locale=en_US), investigates the use of truely Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks in multi-hop Question Answering Systems. My current research interest lies on natural language processing, graph representation learning, Question Answering and multi-modal learning. I'm particuarly interested in using graphs to model relational and multi-modal data for various downstream tasks. Recently, I'm searching for PhD or research assistant openings in NLP and machine learning topics.
